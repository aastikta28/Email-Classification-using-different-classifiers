Text Classification using Decision Tree

Our objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other, 
based only on the text of the email using Decision Tree.

Given a list of strings. 
Each string is the text of an email, which has undergone some basic preprocessing.
(the code to split the dataset into training and testing sets is included.)
